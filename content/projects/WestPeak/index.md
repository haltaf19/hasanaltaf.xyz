description: "I rebuilt the website from scratch using Gatsby as our previous website was suffering from slow loading speeds. The new website has a near perfect lighthouse score, with a performance score that is 185% higher compared to the previous website. Through the use of markdown and Excel files, updating the website can now be done in a matter of seconds (even by non-techy people), as opposed to hours/days of work previously."
skills: ["JavaScript", "React.js", "Gatsby.js"]
