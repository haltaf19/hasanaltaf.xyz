description: "Grouber is an application to help plan your next event requiring carpooling. You create your event, send an invite link to your friends, and create a carpool schedule with one click. As a participant, simply receive a link, RSVP, and inform the organizer of how many seats you have available. 
Using the Radar API and the Google Maps API, along with an algorithm that uses heuristic techniques to find the optimal route and number of drivers given a set of drivers and passengers, the app will create the most optimal carpool schedule for everyone involved."
