description: "Grouber is an application to help plan your next event requiring carpooling. You create your event, send an invite link to your friends, and create a carpool schedule with one click. As a participant, simply receive a link, RSVP, and inform the organizer of how many seats you have available. 

The application determines the optimal route and number of drivers given a set of drivers and passengers. Specifically, it is able to calculate whether it is more efficient for a driver to drive themselves or become a passenger. This is done through an algorithm that is implemented using heuristic techniques alongside the Google Maps and Radar.io API."
