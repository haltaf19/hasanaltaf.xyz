description: "A console based application that uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect arbitrage opportunities. 

The Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the minimum path from a single source vertex to all other vertices on a weighted directed graph. This algorithm is different from Dijkstra as it is able to detect negative-weight cycles. These negative-weight cycles represent arbitrage opportunities in the market and in theory allow us to make risk-free profit.
